/**
 * This module contains the SQL queries to send to AWS timestream db.
 * To do: queries need to have user inputs (read from db) before being sent.
 * 
 * Note:
 *  The idea behind storing all the SQL queries here is to make a transition to sql builders easier.
 *  Recommended to switch to a more readable format (ie: ts-sql-query)
